    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    <img src="../images/cb.jpg" alt="">
    <p>A chicken burger is a delightful alternative to the traditional beef patty, offering a lighter and often
        healthier option for sandwich enthusiasts. Made from ground chicken, these burgers can be seasoned and spiced in
        a variety of ways to enhance their flavor, from classic herbs and spices to bold, exotic blends. Grilled or
        fried, the chicken patty is typically served on a soft bun and can be topped with a variety of fresh ingredients
        such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles, complemented by sauces like mayonnaise, ketchup, or specialty
        aiolis. Whether enjoyed at a casual backyard barbecue or at a gourmet burger joint, the chicken burger provides
        a versatile and tasty meal that caters to diverse palates and dietary preferences.</p>
