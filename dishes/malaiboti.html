    <p>Malai boti is a popular Pakistani dish known for its rich and creamy flavor profile. It consists of tender chunks
        of boneless chicken marinated in a mixture of yogurt, cream (malai), and various spices such as cumin,
        coriander, garam masala, and garlic. This marinade not only tenderizes the chicken but also imparts a velvety
        texture and a subtle yet aromatic taste. After marination, the chicken pieces are skewered and grilled or baked
        until they are succulent and slightly charred, enhancing the dish's complexity. Malai boti is often served hot
        off the grill, garnished with fresh cilantro and served with naan bread or rice, along with mint chutney and
        sliced onions for added zest. Its creamy, mildly spicy flavor makes malai boti a favorite at gatherings and
        celebrations, showcasing the rich culinary traditions of Pakistan.</p>
