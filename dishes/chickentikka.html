    <p>Chicken tikka is a beloved dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, renowned for its bold flavors and
        tender texture. Typically made by marinating bite-sized pieces of chicken in a mixture of yogurt and spices such
        as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder, chicken tikka is then skewered and traditionally cooked in a
        tandoor oven, imparting a smoky char and ensuring juicy perfection. The marinade infuses the chicken with a
        delightful blend of savory and aromatic notes, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and deeply flavorful.
        Chicken tikka is often served with fresh lemon wedges, mint chutney, and sliced onions, allowing diners to
        enhance its taste according to their preferences. Whether enjoyed as a starter or a main course, chicken tikka
        continues to be cherished worldwide for its exquisite taste and cultural significance.</p>
