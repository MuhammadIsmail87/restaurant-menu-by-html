    <h1>Chicken Steak</h1>
    <img src="../images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150">
    <p>Chicken steak is a versatile and flavorful dish that transforms a simple chicken breast or thigh into a hearty
        meal. Typically, the chicken is pounded or sliced to an even thickness, seasoned with a blend of herbs and
        spices, and then grilled, pan-seared, or baked to achieve a golden-brown exterior and tender, juicy interior.
        The dish often features a delicious sauce or marinade, such as a creamy mushroom sauce, tangy barbecue glaze, or
        a zesty lemon-herb dressing, which enhances the natural flavor of the chicken. Accompanied by sides like roasted
        vegetables, fluffy mashed potatoes, or a crisp salad, chicken steak provides a satisfying alternative to
        traditional beef steaks. Its adaptability and lighter profile make it a popular choice for those seeking a
        healthier yet equally delicious meal.</p>
