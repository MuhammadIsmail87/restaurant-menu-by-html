    <img src="../images/Chicken-Karahi-24.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">
    <p>Chicken Shahi Karahi is a luxurious and aromatic dish that originates from the rich culinary traditions of South
        Asia. This regal entr√©e features tender pieces of chicken cooked in a wok-like pan called a karahi, along with a
        medley of spices that create a symphony of flavors. The dish is characterized by its creamy, velvety sauce, made
        from a base of yogurt, cream, and ground nuts, which gives it a distinctive richness and depth. Fragrant
        ingredients such as ginger, garlic, and a blend of garam masala are essential, infusing the chicken with a
        tantalizing aroma and taste. Garnished with fresh coriander and often topped with slivers of almonds or cashews,
        Chicken Shahi Karahi is best enjoyed with warm naan or steamed basmati rice, making it a feast fit for royalty
        that delights the senses with every bite.</p>
