    <h1>Beef Steak</h1>
    <img src="../images/sddefault.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150">
    <p>Beef steak is a quintessential dish that showcases the rich, robust flavors of high-quality beef. This popular
        cut of meat, whether it's a tender ribeye, a flavorful sirloin, or a juicy filet mignon, is often seasoned
        simply with salt and pepper to highlight its natural taste. Grilled, pan-seared, or broiled to the desired level
        of doneness—ranging from rare to well-done—a perfectly cooked steak features a caramelized crust with a
        succulent, tender interior. Accompanied by classic sides like crispy fries, creamy mashed potatoes, or a fresh
        green salad, beef steak is a hearty and indulgent meal that appeals to both casual diners and connoisseurs. Its
        versatility allows it to be paired with a variety of sauces and garnishes, making it a timeless and cherished
        centerpiece of many meals.</p>
