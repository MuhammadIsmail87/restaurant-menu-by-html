    <h1>Mutton Shahi Karahi</h1>
    <img src="../images/mskarahi.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200">
    <p>Mutton Shahi Karahi is a sumptuous and regal dish that embodies the rich culinary traditions of South Asia. This
        delectable curry features tender pieces of mutton cooked in a wok-like vessel called a "karahi," which allows
        for high-heat searing and deep flavors. The "Shahi" in its name signifies its royal origins, often incorporating
        a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala, along with a rich, creamy base made from
        yogurt or cream. Tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and green chilies are commonly added to enhance its depth and
        complexity. Garnished with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon, Mutton Shahi Karahi is typically enjoyed with
        naan or steamed rice, making it a favorite for special occasions and festive gatherings, where its hearty and
        luxurious taste leaves a lasting impression.</p>
